# Variation of the Double Pendulum: A Bead on an Elliptical Wire

## The Problem

A point mass $m$ slides frictionless on an elliptical wire. We are given the mass distribution $\rho$ or the center-of-mass $(x_0,y_0)$, total mass $M$, and moment of inertia $I$ of the elliptical wire. The elliptical wire lies within a vertical $x$-$y$ plane and rotates freely around an axis (in $z$-direction) around its center. It is connected to a torsional spring with constant $D$.

## What we do

We formulate the Lagrangian of the system, find the Euler-Lagrange equations, and solve the latter numerically, finding chaotic behavior. We also analyze the system for stable points and perform small-angle expansions around these configurations. In this setting, we derive analytic solutions and find the normal modes.
